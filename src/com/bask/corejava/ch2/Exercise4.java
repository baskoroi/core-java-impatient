 int variables? Instead, write a method that swaps the contents of two 
 IntHolder objects. (Look up this rather obscure class in the API 
 documentation.) Can you integerObjectSwap the contents of two Integer objects?

     * Answer 1: Because Java is strictly pass-by-value.

     * Pass-by-value approach cannot directly change the parameter values where
     * the actual variables reside, i.e. <code>main()</code>, etc.
     * 
     * Therefore, we can't expect primitive values to be modified/swapped after
     * the scope of that <code>swap()</code> method.
     * 
     * Method parameters in Java methods are either primitive values or 
     * object references, and they are all passed by value.

     * state by changing their values. This method is also pass-by-value, but
     * we are directly changing the internal value of all the IntHolder
     * objects here (using the <code>.value</code> property) -- hence the 
     * ability to 'swap' the values.

     * the method where this swap method is called, i.e. <code>main()</code>,

     * When this method is invoked w/ some Integer objects, 
     * 
     * Outside this function's scope: the Integer objects will not point 
     * to their opposite -- they will yet refer to the previous values.
     * 
     * Only inside the scope does the values get 'swapped', only in terms of
     * which the parameter variables point to. But in the other method where 
     * this method is called, the values do not change anyhow.
